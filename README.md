# ItemMaker
A plugin to customize items. This plugin allows you to customize the name, lore, flags, unbreakability and attributes of an item with simple commands. This is perfect for map makers or server owners who want to add a little flair to their items.

## Commands
All commands require the `ItemMaker.main` permission. All text related commands support `&` color codes (ex. `&c&lDemon Blade`). All lore related commands support using `\n` to represent an empty line of lore.
